# 💫 About Me:
Hi, I’m Aditya Raj, a Computer Science Engineering student with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence. I am currently in my first year of college, focused on building a strong and disciplined foundation in Data Structures & Algorithms, Java, and core computer science concepts.<br><br>I actively practice problem-solving on LeetCode, sharpening my algorithmic thinking, writing efficient code, and preparing for technical interviews. Alongside DSA, I am developing expertise in Git, GitHub, and software development best practices to ensure clean, scalable, and maintainable code.<br><br>My interests lie at the intersection of AI, full-stack development, and impactful engineering. I enjoy building projects that solve real-world problems, particularly those that create value for local communities and end users.<br><br>I strongly believe in consistency, depth of understanding, and learning by building. My long-term goal is to grow into a high-impact software engineer, contribute to meaningful products, and secure opportunities at top technology companies through skill, discipline, and execution.
